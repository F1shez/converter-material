# Converter Material

This project converts material textures from specular/glossiness workflow to metallic/roughness workflow. It is built using Vite, SolidJS, and TailwindCSS.

Warning: This project may not be accurate. I created custom shader for show specular/glossines workflow from physicmaterial meshphysical.glsl.js it may not be accurate for this workflow.
